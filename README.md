## Repositories

- [bot](https://github.com/seg-org/rag-bot)
- [api](https://github.com/seg-org/rag-api)

Making a bot that can **leverage documents** with **RAG** to generate relevant responses.

## Design
![diagram](./docs/diagram.png)
### Discord Bot
- /add-text: Adds text to the vector database knowledge base.
- /add-web: Adds web page (you input the url, the API will load data from that page) to the vector database knowledge base.
- /toggle-web-search: Toggles whether the bot should search the web for data when it can't find any in the vector database.

Note: the requests the bot makes to the API have guild IDs in the url params in order to keep track of the loaded documents for each guild **separately**.

### FastAPI
acts as an interface between the Discord bot and the Langchain ReAct Agent

### LangChain ReAct Agent
To be precise, ReAct Agents are from LangGraph library, which is a part of LangChain. ReAct Agents find answers to queries using the tools we provided: Docs retriever tool and Tavily search tool.
- Docs retriever tool: This tool retrieves documents from the vector database that are relevant to the query.
- Tavily search tool: This tool searches the internet for relevant data when the Docs retriever tool can't find any relevant data in the vector database.
